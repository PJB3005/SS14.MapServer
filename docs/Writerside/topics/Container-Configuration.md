# Container Configuration

This section contains the configuration for the container runner.
The container runner is not implemented yet so setting any of these doesn't make sense.

````yaml
Container:
  [[[DockerHost|#dockerhost]]]: <string>
````

## Configuration Options

### DockerHost
`<string>`

The docker host url used to access the docker api for creating and stopping containers.
This needs to be a valid url.
